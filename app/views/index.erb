                <p>
                    The act of comparing yourself to others can be valuable, but it can also be toxic.  The feeling of inferiority that come from constant comparisons and self-judgment can block you before you get started.

                   Many smart, driven people suffer from comparative attacks.  A common phenomenon is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank">imposter syndrome</a>, which makes people unable to internalize their accomplishments.

                    Whether it be pictures with motivational text, meditation or a change of environment, whatever you can do to quell comparative attacks before they turn into a negative spiral is crucial.

                   Mantras are words, sounds or phrases that are repeated to aid concentration.  Often they help anchor us and allow us to move forward or past a comparative attack.
